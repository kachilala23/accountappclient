Right after that, let’s import that type definition inside the tsconfig.app.json file:


"styles": [
    "./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "./node_modules/jqueryui/jquery-ui.min.css",
    "src/styles.css"
  ],
"scripts": [
    "./node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
    "./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js",
    "./node_modules/jqueryui/jquery-ui.min.js"
  ],

  "types": [
    "jquery",
    "bootstrap",
    "jqueryui"
  ]

ng g component home --skipTests

In here we import OnInit interface which defines the function ngOnInit.
This function will execute any logic inside
it as soon as the component initializes. Notice the constructor as well.

When we create more than one module inside the application, we can use the forRoot()
function provided by the RouterModule, only in the main(root) module. In this project,
it is the app.module file. In all other modules, we must use the forChild() function.
The forRoot() function accepts an array of objects as a parameter.

Services are just classes, which provide us with some business logic relevant to our
components. These services must be injected into a component using constructor injection.
Furthermore, our code becomes more maintainable and readable.

The urlAddress property accepts the value of the urlAddress defined in the environment file.
Angular knows if it is a production or development environment and is going
to supply us with a valid value of that urlAddress. You can check that in the angular.json file:

Let’s explain repositoryService

First, we are injecting the Angular HttpClient and the environment variable into the constructor.
Then we are creating functions that are going to wrap our requests. The getData function is a wrapper
for all GET requests. It accepts the route parameter of type string (api/owner or api/owner/id …)
and then combines it with the environment variable (localhost or www…). After all of that, we are going
to have the route like http://localhost:5000/api/owner if it is a development environment, which perfectly
fits our requirements on the server-side.

The second function, create, is a wrapper for POST requests. It also generates a route, but additionally
receives a body (an entity which we are creating) and generate headers. For this example, we are just
creating the Content-Type inside the header. But if we need additional values inside the header, we could
just add another key-value pair inside the HttpHeaders object.

The update function is pretty much the same as the createfunction, except, it sends the PUT request.

Lastly, the delete function is a wrapper for the DELETE request which accepts the route like (api/owner/id).

ng g module owner

There are two small differences between this module file and the app module file. The first difference
is that in the app module file we have an import statement for the BrowserModule, and in the owner
module file, we have an import statement for the CommonModule. That’s because the BrowserModule is only
related to the root module in the application.

The second difference is that we don’t have providers array inside the owner module file. That’s because we
should register all the services in the root module. That way components will inject the same instance of
the service only once and you can keep the state in your service.

Of course, if you really want to register a service inside any child module, you could just add providers array.
But, by doing so you cannot keep the state inside your service because every time we create a new instance of that
component a new instance of a service is created.

Again, the best practice for large projects is to keep router array in the separate file, but for the sake
of the simplicity of this example, we are keeping it inside the forRoot function.

First of all, we are injecting the Router which we use for redirecting the user to other pages in the code.
In the method handleError(), we are checking for the error’s status code, and based on that we are calling
the right private method for handling that error. The handle404Error() and handle500Error() functions are
responsible for populating the errorMessage property. We are going to use this property as a modal error message
or an error page message. We are going to deal with the handleOtherError() function later, thus the comment inside.
